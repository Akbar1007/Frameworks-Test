# Hono Framework

### ✅ Built-in Features

Validation helpers
Routing groups
Request context management
Cookie utilities
Authentication helpers

### Blazing Fast

Hono is designed for speed, often faster than Express or other traditional Node.js frameworks.
Its core is optimized for low latency, which makes it great for serverless and edge computing platforms (like Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions).

### Lightweight

Tiny footprint (~20KB minified). Minimal overhead means it’s ideal for resource-constrained environments.
Less bloat than bigger frameworks like Express or Koa.

### TypeScript First

Comes with first-class TypeScript support out of the box.
You get type safety, autocomplete, and better developer experience without much setup.

### Edge-Ready

Hono is built for Edge runtimes:
Cloudflare Workers
Deno
Bun
Vercel Edge Functions
It works seamlessly in serverless and edge environments where traditional Node.js frameworks struggle.

### Simple and Minimal API

Similar to Express in syntax, making it easy to learn.
You can build APIs with fewer lines of code and a cleaner structure.

```
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello Hono!'))

export default app

```

### Middleware Support

Supports middleware (like Express), but with better performance.
Middleware is composable and type-safe.

### When to use this framework:

When you want high performance.
If you deploy to Edge platforms.
If you prefer TypeScript and type safety.
For REST APIs, microservices, or lightweight backends.
If you need something simpler and faster than Express or Koa.
